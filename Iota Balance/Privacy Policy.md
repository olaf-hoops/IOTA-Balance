1. Introduction

The App allows you to check the balances of IOTA addresses. 
The app won't need your private seed to work and it will never ask for it. 
You only need to provide a valid IOTA address and the app will call the IOTA network for the current balance. 
Your addresses are only stored locally on your phone and you can delete them any time.

2. What personal data will be stored

Addresses you add to the app will be stored on your phone only. 
The app won't store anything else than the addresses you provide.
No personal data will be stored, used or tranfered to third parties.

3. Sharing of data with third partys

The IOTA network will be called to retrieve the current value of the IOTA addresses you provide.
The app will call the following node to retrieve the balance of the address: https://nodes.thetangle.org
Addresses in the tangle are publicly available anyway, and can be checked on any tangle viewer like for example https://thetangle.org.
